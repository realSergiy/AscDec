# AscDesc

Would you beat the O(n) performance of the Array.IndexOf to find a number in the array, provided that:

- elements of the array are unique
- elements are sorted so that first random length portion of the array goes ascending, second goes descending

**Example**: 1 2 4 5 6 9 11 10 8 7 3

To try your code, replace the implementation of the [Find](https://github.com/realSergiy/AscDec/blob/master/AscDec/Program.cs#L66) method
